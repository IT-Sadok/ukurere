There is a chemical laboratory. Through the commands of the console we can add ("add") or subtract ("div") substances to this laboratory.
The laboratory has a limit for the amount of substances, thus one can't add more than this limit and can't subtract when it brings the number below zero.
The console has to contain corresponding comments like "The number of substances on the shelf is max." when the number of substances is at its maximum.
"Error" when the number is at zero.
If the command is given incorrectly, the message on the console should be "Your command is incorrect."
