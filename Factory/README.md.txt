You have a factory where 100 machines constantly deliver parts, and another 100 machines constantly pick up finished products. You need to create a program in C# that implements this interaction using asynchronous methods, tasks (`Task`), and synchronization primitives (`SemaphoreSlim`). The program should synchronize the delivery of parts and the pickup of finished products, ensuring the correct operation of the factory without blocking threads.
